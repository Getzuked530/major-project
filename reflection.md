## Hardest 
- multiple dialogue branches and having to have it branch off into multiple paths and then return back to one linear path. We solved it by giving each one a characteristic and then check which characteristic was chosen then and go to the dialogue that correlates to that.
- getting the scene to change when a sound effect stops playing. this was one of the first problems we encountered. we found the isPlaying() function and after some playing around we got it to work.
## Most proud 
- the dialogue system and the ending. we thought that it was really cool having multiple endings. and were proud that the dialogue system works but it also doesnt work.
## DO IT AGAIN
- fix the dialogue bug. add better branching paths. more endings. remaster mini-game and make it harder. use even more files so that things dont break when two people edit. work on some of the typos.

## Needs to have/wants
- we almost completed all our needs to have. there was one idea that we ditched and some ideas that we downgraded due to lack of time.
## Beta tester feedback
- include instructions for minigame (implemented)
- implement your name into the games dialogue (implemented)
- the thought of dating shrek is appalling (will not be implemented)
